欢迎来到我的 LeetCode playground！这里是我记录大部分 LeetCode 解决方案的地方，包括中文解释和数学推导（也是中文的哦）。

每日更新刷题进度:

目前我正在积极找工作，所以每天都会练习 LeetCode。我的目标是每天解决 15 个新问题，复习和优化 8 个旧问题。当前仓库的代码被分类如下：

* *exercise* 文件夹中包含零散的练习。
* *categories* 文件夹包含按类别划分的 LeetCode 问题，例如回溯，动态规划或二分查找 etc 。

Welcome to my very own Leetcode playground! Here, I'll showcase my most impressive coding feats, with explanations so brilliant that you'll swear they were written in an alien language. (OK, they're actually in Chinese, but still pretty cool, right?)

As I search for the ultimate job, I practice the ancient art of Leetcode with unwavering intensity each day. My goal is to solve at least 15 new problems daily, while reviewing and optimizing 8 old ones. And just to keep things interesting, I've sorted these brainteasers into neat little categories:

* Behold, the *Exercise* folder, filled with sneaky and mischievous exercises
* And the *Categories* folder, home to the most fearsome Leetcode beasts, categorized by their specialties such as Backtrace, DP, and many more!
